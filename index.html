            <p class="p-font">2021 has beenâ€¦ a year, which makes getting a fresh start in 2022 feel super appealing. For
                some people,
                that might mean making a New Year's resolution that helps them get the year started on the right foot.
                The thing is though, traditional New Year's resolutions usually fail. Turns out, our brains are just not
                into making swift, abrupt changes to our habits. So instead of going for the typical diet, exercise, or
                financial overhaul-style resolution, why not try something a little different this year? Evaluate any
                potential resolution you come up with, according to Kate Morton, a registered dietitian and founder of
                Funk It Wellness.</p>

                <h4>Commit to only doing exercise you actually like.</h4>
                <p class="p-font">"Many people who were isolated at home went out and bought equipment that they never
                    used because it
                    did not fulfill them or bring them enjoyment," says Elisha Contner Wilkins.There are a few reasons
                    this happens. One is ramping up too quickly. But there's another big factor. "When it comes to
                    exercise (or movement or activity as I prefer to call it), it's equally important that we find a way
                    to move our bodies that we not only look forward to, but that brings us joy," Wilkins says. "Many
                    associate movement with going to a gym and sweating versus choosing something that brings a smile to
                    their face." So this year, consider focusing on whatever type of movement feels fun.</p>

                <h4>Be more intentional about eating your food.</h4>
                <p class="p-font">"Instead of embarking on a super restrictive diet for 2022, what if you dug a bit
                    deeper this time
                    and focused on changing your relationship to food?" asks Natalie Moore. Diet culture encourages us
                    to focus on calories, macronutrients, detoxes, and "off-limits" foods, which at best leaves you in a
                    scarcity mindset, and at worst sets you up for a shame spiral as soon as you "cheat" on the diet
                    that was never realistic to begin with, Moore points out.Instead, she recommends focusing on being
                    more mindful about one or all of the following areas: how you cook your food, how you source it, and
                    how you eat it. Importantly, you don't have to tackle all of these at once.</p>

                <h4>Start therapy.</h4>
                <p class="p-font">We said it last year and we'll say it again: There couldn't be a better time to begin
                    therapy if you
                    haven't already. "There are always things to talk about, especially as we reflect on the major
                    shifts that have occurred [since the pandemic]," says Sarah Levine-Miles, a licensed clinical social
                    worker who works with MotherFigure. "Taking an hour out of the week to reflect and discuss how you
                    are doing with a professional who can help guide you and shift your perspective is invaluable."</p>
